###Human–Robot Interaction (HRI)

Human–Robot Interaction (HRI) is a field of study dedicated to understanding, designing, and evaluating robotic systems for use by or with humans.
Interaction, by definition, requires communication between robots and human. HRI abilities, presents working implementations, 
and shows how they combine in a coherent and original deliberative architecture for human–robot interaction. Supported by experimental results,
we eventually show how explicit knowledge management, both symbolic and geometric, 
proves to be instrumental to richer and more natural human–robot interactions by pushing for pervasive, 
human-level semantics within the robot’s deliberative system.
