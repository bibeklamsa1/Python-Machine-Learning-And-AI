K Nearest Neighbor â€“ KNN Algorithm


This paper proposes the introduction to the K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm and its Applications.
It is a basically classification problem.KNN Algorithm currently provide the best solutions to many classification problems
like Face Recognition, Recommendation Systems (Amazon, Netflix), Text Mining, Diabetes in patients.
